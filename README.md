## whois
### Tools
- whois

### Challenges
1. Perform a WHOIS lookup against the paypal.com domain. What is the registrar Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) ID number?

    We can solve this just by using `whois`.
    ```bash
    whois paypal.com
    ```
    Then we can look in the Registrar IANA ID line.

2. What is the admin email contact for the tesla.com domain (also in-scope for the Tesla bug bounty program)?

    Like in the previous, we can solve this using `whois` again.

    ```bash
    whois tesla.com
    ```
    Then we can look in the Registrant Email line.

## DNS and Subdomains
### Digging DNS
#### Tools
- dig
- nslookup
- host
- dnsenum
- fierce
- dnsrecon
- theHarvester
- Online DNS Lookup Services

#### Challenges
1. Which IP address maps to inlanefreight.com?

    To solve this we can use `dig` combine with `A` to retrive IPv4 address.

    ```bash
    dig inlanefreight.com A
    ```

2. Which domain is returned when querying the PTR record for 134.209.24.248?

    We can get the answer from the previous image. Here the details.

3. What is the full domain returned when you query the mail records for facebook.com?

    We can combine `dig` with MX to get the full domain when querying the mail record.

    ```bash
    dig facebook.com MX 
    ```

### Subdomain Bruteforcing
#### Tools
- dnsenum
- ffuf
- gobuster 
- fierce
- dnsrecon
- amass
- assetfinder	
- puredns

#### Challenges
1. Using the known subdomains for inlanefreight.com (www, ns1, ns2, ns3, blog, support, customer), find any missing subdomains by brute-forcing possible domain names. Provide your answer with the complete subdomain, e.g., www.inlanefreight.com.

    To solve this, we can use dnsenum with SecList wordlist.

    ```bash
    dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f  /home/mrwhok/tools/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt
    ```

    Here the output.

### DNS Zone Transfers
#### Tools
- dig
#### Challenges
1. After performing a zone transfer for the domain inlanefreight.htb on the target system, how many DNS records are retrieved from the target system's name server? Provide your answer as an integer, e.g, 123.

    We can use dig to solve this.
    ```bash
    dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.140.80
    ```
    Here the result. 

    ![alt text](assets/DNS5.png)

    Based on that, the answer is 22. We count from first SOA until last SOA.

2. Within the zone record transferred above, find the ip address for ftp.admin.inlanefreight.htb. Respond only with the IP address, eg 127.0.0.1

    We can get the answer from the previous output.

3. Within the same zone record, identify the largest IP address allocated within the 10.10.200 IP range. Respond with the full IP address, eg 10.10.200.1

    The answer is 10.10.200.14 from the first output.

## Automating Recon
### Tools
- FinalRecon
- Recon-ng
- theHarvester
- SpiderFoot
- OSINT Framework

## Skill Assesment
Before work on the task, i added domain to my host.
```bash
echo "94.237.123.119 inlanefreight.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
1. What is the IANA ID of the registrar of the inlanefreight.com domain?

    We can solve this using `whois` and find IANA lines.

    ```bash
    whois inlanefreight.com
    ```

    The answer is `468`.

2. What http server software is powering the inlanefreight.htb site on the target system? Respond with the name of the software, not the version, e.g., Apache.

    We can solve this using `curl -I`.

    ```bash
    curl -I http://inlanefreight.htb:37249
    ```

    The answer is `nginx`.

3. What is the API key in the hidden admin directory that you have discovered on the target system?

    To solve this, in here i used `ffuf` to bruteforce the VHOSTS.
    
    ```bash
    ffuf -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://94.237.122.241:33800 -H "Host: FUZZ.inlanefreight.htb" -fs 120
    ```

    Here the result, we find `web1337`.

    ![alt text](assets/FA1.png)

    Then i modified /etc/hosts to add that vhosts, `94.237.122.241 inlanefreight.htb web1337.inlanefreight.htb`. After that, we used `ffuf` again but now to find any folder/file in there.

    ```bash
    ffuf -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt:FUZZ -u http://web1337.inlanefreight.htb:33800/FUZZ -e .html
    ```

    ![alt text](assets/FA2.png)

    We can see it have robots.txt. Here the content of it.

    ![alt text](assets/FA3.png)

    It have suspicious path, `/admin_h1dd3n`. Then we check the content of it.

    ![alt text](assets/FA4.png)

    Here we get the API Key. The answer is `e963d863ee0e82ba7080fbf558ca0d3f`.

4. After crawling the inlanefreight.htb domain on the target system, what is the email address you have found? Respond with the full email, e.g., mail@inlanefreight.htb.

    I have tried using `ReconSpider.py` to crawl `web1337.inlanefreight.htb` but its got nothing. So i tried to FUZZ again to find any VHOSTS from that.

    ```bash
    ffuf -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://94.237.122.241:33800 -H "Host: FUZZ.web1337.inlanefreight.htb" -fs 120
    ```

    We get `dev` from that. Then i tried using `ReconSpider.py` again but with `dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb`. Dont forget to add that in the /etc/hosts too.

    ```bash
    python ReconSpider.py http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:33800
    ```
    Then we can get the result in the email section from results.json. The answer is `1337testing@inlanefreight.htb`.

5. What is the API key the inlanefreight.htb developers will be changing too?

    We can get the answer from `ReconSpider.py` result in the comment section. The answer is `ba988b835be4aa97d068941dc852ff33`.
